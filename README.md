# iMediaSorter

A simple commandline application that will sort any file that doesn't match the default file naming scheme into a folder.


## Getting started

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/Myuuiii/iMediaSorter/releases). After that, place the .jar file in the same location as the folder that you want to sort.

## Usage

Execute the following command to start the application

```java
java -jar iMediaSorter.jar
```

This will ask you for the directory name, this can be an absolute path or a relative path. After you press enter the app will quickly show the amount of files detected and wait for input to start sorting.

In the folder that you targeted, a folder called "External" will be created. This is where files are moved when they don't match the default naming scheme.
